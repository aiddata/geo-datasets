The raster used is the result of aggregating one year of data to a 10km grid and then using a linear interpolation to fill gaps. The underlying data were produced by NASA's OCO-2 project, and obtained from the OCO-2 data archive maintained at the NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center.",
