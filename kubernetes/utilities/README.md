## Create kubernetes-job infrastructure block in Prefect

I wrote a script that creates a Kubernetes Job infrastructure block in Prefect that you can use to deploy things into the cluster.
Here's how you use it:

```shell
conda activate geodata38
# edit config variables in create-k8s-job-block.py
python create-k8s-job-block.py
```
